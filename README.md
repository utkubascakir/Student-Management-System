# Student Management System

A terminal-based Java application designed to manage student records, course enrollments, and GPA calculations. This project was developed as a practical exercise to master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** fundamentals during my second year of university.

## 📌 Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to implement core OOP concepts in a real-world scenario:
* **Encapsulation:** Managing data through private fields and public getters/setters.
* **Composition:** Establishing relationships between `School`, `Student`, and `Course` classes.
* **Abstraction:** Designing a modular system where each class has a single, clear responsibility.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Student Management:** Add, search, and delete student profiles within the school system.
* **Course Tracking:** Enroll students in specific courses with associated grades.
* **Automated Calculations:** Real-time GPA calculation based on the student's course list.
* **Data Organization:** Uses `ArrayList` for dynamic data management and `Scanner` for interactive CLI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
* **Tools:** Java Collections Framework (List, ArrayList)

## 📂 Class Structure
* `Main`: Handles the user interface and menu navigation.
* `School`: The top-level container managing the list of students.
* `Student`: Represents individual students and their academic records.
* `Course`: Stores course-specific data such as code, name, and grade.
